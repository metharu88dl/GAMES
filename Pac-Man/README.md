## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

# JAVA PAC-MAN Game:-
Key features:
----:: Approximation Technique ::----
Basically when the pac-man, tries to change direction (opening is present), currently it requires to change only at one exact particular time frame,, a frame after or early won't accept, since it leads to collision.. hence proceeds in same direction, we can't actually expect the user to change direction, focusing on exact time-frame, so Approximation is required....

----:: LEVEL-Upgradation ::----
Actually whenever, the pac-man successfully finishes all the foods, he should be given a life extra as BONUS, and procees to level 2.. where difficulty should increase, as well the MAP also,, ghosts speed should increase too..
